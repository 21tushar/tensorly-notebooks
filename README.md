# Example notebooks for TensorLy

This repository contains tutorials and examples on how to perform tensor operations using TensorLy and the newly added MXNet backend.

The MXNet backend will soon be merged into master.
However, if you want to try it right now, you need to install from the mxnet branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly
cd tensorly
git checkout mxnet
git pull origin mxnet
pip install -e .
```

You are ready to go!
